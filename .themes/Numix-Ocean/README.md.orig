This is the excellent Numix theme, altered to use Base16 Ocean colors (see link below). It's a clean, desaturated, bluish theme.

<<<<<<< HEAD
As of right now, I've edited the GTK2, GTK3, XFWM4, and Openbox themes to use Base16 Ocean colors. The GTK3 theme contains several graphical assets which I will need to change. Then I can move on to Metacity, etc.

Numix is a part of the [Numix Project](http://numixproject.org).

### Manual installation

Extract the zip file to the themes directory i.e. `/usr/share/themes/`

To set the theme in Gnome, run the following commands in Terminal,

```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Numix"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Numix"
```

To set the theme in Xfce, run the following commands in Terminal,

```
xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -s "Numix"
xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme -s "Numix"
